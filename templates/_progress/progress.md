# Progress Log

Agents must read this file before planning and before touching code for each task.

Append a new entry after each task. Do not replace previous entries except to correct factual errors.

This file is append-only task history. `_handoff/current.md` is the live resume state for the active workflow, and `_summary/` is completed workflow history.

If `_handoff/current.md` conflicts with this file, trust this file for completed task history and update handoff accordingly.

## Task Status Transitions

Every task must move through:

```txt
Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done
```

Allowed terminal states:

- `Done`
- `Blocked`
- `Needs Human Review`

If verification cannot run, record the task as `Needs Human Review`, not `Done`.

## Execution Modes

Default execution mode is `complete-workflow`.

- `plan-only`: ask questions, write spec, write task plan, then stop.
- `single-task`: execute only the next ready task, verify and review it, update artifacts, then stop.
- `complete-workflow`: execute all generated tasks sequentially until the request/spec is complete or a stop condition is reached.

Do not stop after `TASK-001` unless execution mode is explicitly `single-task` or a stop condition is reached.

## Entry Template

### `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` - `<TASK-ID>`

- Status: `<Done / Blocked / Needs Human Review>`
- Lifecycle transition reached: `<Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done, or terminal stop>`
- Files changed: `<paths or none>`
- Verification result: `<commands and result, or why verification could not run>`
- Review result: `<reviewed / issues found / not reviewed with reason>`
- Blockers: `<none or details>`
- Next step: `<next task, review, summary, or stop reason>`

After appending each task entry, update `_handoff/current.md` with the latest current state.
